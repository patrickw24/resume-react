        <p>Hi! I'm Patrick, an aspiring Web Developer with a passion for creating user-friendly, engaging digital experiences. Currently, I'm enhancing my coding skills through formal training, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

Before diving into web development, I spent several years honing my customer service skills, where I learned the importance of communication, problem-solving, and putting the user first. As I continue to grow my technical expertise, I'm excited to combine my strong customer experience background with my new coding skills to build intuitive websites and applications.</p>
