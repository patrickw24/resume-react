      <p>
        
        Hello! My name is Patrick, and I am currently pursuing my education to
        become a Web Developer. With several years of experience in customer
        service, I am transitioning into the tech field and focusing on
        developing my skills in web development. I bring a strong background in
        delivering exceptional customer experiences, which I believe will
        complement my technical expertise as I continue to build proficiency in
        languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others. My goal is to
        leverage my experience in communication and problem-solving to create
        user-friendly, responsive web applications.
      </p>
